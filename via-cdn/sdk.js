/**
 * ==================== Task API ====================
 *
 * These APIs are optional to integrate but we STRONGLY recommend you to integrate them.
 * The task API is designed to help us track the player's progress in your game so that we can provide you with better rewards.
 * 
 * There are 3 APIs:
 * 1. onLevelFinished - Send a level/checkpoint finished event to the server.
 * 2. onGamePlayEnded - Send a game play ended event to the server.
 * 3. onLevelUpgrade - Send a player upgrade event to the server.
 * 
 * For method 1 and 2, you can just choose one of them to integrate.
